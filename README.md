# tty-format-linecr.el
An enhancement of https://user42.tuxfamily.org/tty-format

Added formatter `linecr-hide`, to hide part of a long line before the last carriage-return character, ^M.

Typical Use Case: Collapse a long line consisting of updates to a progress indicator, to a shorter line showing only the part that would normally be visible on screen.
